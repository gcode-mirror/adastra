1. Save/Load model
- too slow?

2. Background test for Train Form  
- record
- Process

3. Background thread for the ClassifyForm

4. Make 4 scenarios for release 2.0 
- train\classify + EEG visualize + OpenVibe Classification output
- change enumeration - done
- fix parameter problem - done

5. Make MLP train properly 
- randomize input vectors 
- separate 1:4 validate\train sets

- check by distance which is the closest class insted of rounding below
- or make NN has an ouput for every class
